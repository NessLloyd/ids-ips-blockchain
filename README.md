# AI + Blockchain Intrusion Detection System

This project integrates a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with a blockchain-based logging mechanism using Streamlit for real-time web interaction.

## Features

- Detects intrusions using Random Forest trained on UNSW-NB15 dataset
- Logs each detected threat into a blockchain
- Allows tracing of previous incidents by user ID, transaction ID, or cookie
- Web interface built with Streamlit
