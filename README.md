## Features

- Detects intrusions using Random Forest trained on UNSW-NB15 dataset
- Logs each detected threat into a blockchain
- Allows tracing of previous incidents by user ID, transaction ID, or cookie
- Web interface built with Streamlit

### ðŸš¨ Upload and Detection Interface

This view shows the Streamlit interface where a user uploads a network log and receives an immediate intrusion detection result. If a threat is detected, it is automatically logged to the blockchain.

### ðŸ§¾ Blockchain Trace Result

After an intrusion is detected and logged, users can trace incidents using a unique identifier such as the user ID, transaction ID, or cookie. The screenshot below shows a successful trace result, displaying the full block details recorded on the blockchain.
